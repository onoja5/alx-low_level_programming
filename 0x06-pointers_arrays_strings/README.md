More pointers, arrays and strings in C Programming Language:
This project was done during Full Stack Software Engineering at ALX Africa. It aims to learn the following:

-Pointers and how to use them
-Arrays and how to use them
-Differences between pointers and arrays
-How to use strings and how to manipulate them
-Understand the scope of variables

Tools and Technologies deployed and used are:

- Editors allowed: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files where compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- The code used where Betty style. 
- The prototypes of all the functions and the prototype of the function _putchar where included in the header file called main.h
