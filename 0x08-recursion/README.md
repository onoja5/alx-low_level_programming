Recursion in C Programming Language

Project was carried out during Full Stack Software Engineering course in ALX Africa. The aim to learn the
following.

What recursion is
How to implement recursion
In what situations you should one implement recursion
In what situations one shouldnâ€™t implement recursion


Filename	         Description
0-puts_recursion.c =	This function prints a string, followed by a new line

1-print_rev_recursion.c = This function prints a string in reverse

2-strlen_recursion.c	= This function returns the length of a string

3-factorial.c	   = This function returns the factorial of a given number

4-pow_recursion.c  =   This function returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

5-sqrt_recursion.c =   This function returns the natural square root of a number

6-is_prime_number.c =	This function returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0

7-is_palindrome.c =	This function returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not
100-wildcmp.c	= This functions compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical. Otherwise, returns 0
